## Development Philosophy 

The Go community uses a consistent style. If you use the Go extension in VSCode with its recommended tools and settings, formatting is done automatically. When contributing to our projects, please adhere to the folloing points:
*	Always explain steps/commands above the command.
*	Shorten code as much as possible.
*	Design code for reuse. Help developers determine what to modify outside the code.
*	Show or name expected output.
*	Make code secure, if possible. If you can't, remind the user that it is not safe and provide information how to secure it.

If you need further guidance, please refer to Microsoft’s Writing Style Guide https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/ as well as standard Go style guides (e. g. https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

## Pull Request Process

Edgeless Systems welcomes any suggestions and contributions. Submissions should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.
For pull requests, we employ the following workflow:
1.	Fork the repository to your own Github account
2.	Clone the project to your computer
3.	Create a branch locally with a distinct but descriptive name, e.g. 
•	Feat/ -> Feature
•	Ref/ -> Refactor
•	Test/ -> Testing
•	Fix/ -> Fixes
4.	Commit changes to the branch
5.	Write your code according to our development philosophy and the style of existing code
6.	Push changes to your fork
7.	Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

A Pull Request may only be merged into master by a maintainer if:
*	It has been approved by at least two maintainers. If the PR was opened by a maintainer, only one additional maintainer is needed for approval
*	It has no requested changes.
*	It is up to date with current master
Any maintainer may merge a PR if all of these conditions are met. Our team maintainers will review your PR and notify you in case any information is missing. They will wait up to 20 days for your interaction, after that the PR will be closed.

## Major Changes
